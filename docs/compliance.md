# Compliance Reference

FortressWAF includes security controls that may help satisfy certain compliance requirements. This document maps available features to common compliance frameworks for reference.

**Important:** Compliance requires organization-wide policies, processes, and controls. A WAF alone cannot make you compliant with any framework. This document is a reference for auditors and security teams evaluating FortressWAF.
